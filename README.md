Text based assement
made in visual studio 2019

to build, right click the project in the solution exploerer then click public then select a folder profile and choose the empty folder you wish to build to and public

My game is a text based rpg where you use the letters in brackets to do commands
for example if r is in the bracket you press R to do the command.

controls are purely keyboard
